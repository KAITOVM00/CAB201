# Question 2b

### Description

Write a method, `bool IsArraySorted(int []numbers)` that returns `true` if the elements of numbers are in sorted order, ascending or descending, and `false`, if they are not in any sorted order. You can assume that there are no duplicate values and that there is at least one value in the array numbers.

Remember that a list consisting of only 1 value is sorted.
